- 100% private (everything processes client-side in your browser)
- No signup required
- No limits

### Reddit r/startups
**Title:** I built a free PDF editor that's actually free – no signup, no watermarks, 100% private
**Subreddit:** r/startups (also consider r/SideProject, r/InternetIsBeautiful)
**Body:**
I got frustrated with "free" PDF tools that surprise you with paywalls at download time, so I built EditPDFs.app.

**What it does:**
- Edit text, add signatures, merge/split PDFs, annotate, compress
- 100% client-side processing (files never upload anywhere)
- No signup, no watermarks, no limits

**What makes it different:**
Most "free" PDF editors either watermark your files, require accounts, or demand payment when you try to save. EditPDFs.app is genuinely free — supported by unobtrusive ads instead of subscription traps.

**Privacy:**
Everything runs in your browser using JavaScript. I literally can't see your documents because they never leave your device.

Just launched on Product Hunt. Would love any feedback!
